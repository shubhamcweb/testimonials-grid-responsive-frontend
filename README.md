### What I learned

During this project, I had the opportunity to learn and apply several key concepts and techniques in frontend web development. Some of the major learnings from this project include:

- Responsive design principles and techniques, including media queries and mobile-first development.
- Effective use of Flexbox for creating flexible and responsive layouts.
- Styling elements using CSS custom properties for easy maintenance and consistency.
- Utilizing semantic HTML5 markup for improved accessibility and search engine optimization.
- Implementing CSS box-shadow to add depth and visual appeal to elements.

### Continued development

While working on this project, I identified a few areas that I would like to continue focusing on in future projects. These include:

Further enhancing my understanding of CSS layout techniques, such as CSS Grid, to create more complex and versatile designs.
Exploring and implementing CSS animations and transitions to add dynamic and engaging elements to websites.
Deepening my knowledge of JavaScript and its libraries/frameworks to develop interactive and feature-rich web applications.

### Useful resources

- [HTML Color Converter](https://htmlcolors.com/color-converter) - A really useful tool to convert different color values from (and to) different formats like RGB, HEX, HSL, etc.
- [Box Shadow CSS Generator](https://www.example.com) - An amazing tool that lets you visually experiment with different box-shadow parameters and outputs the CSS to implement that.
